Learning concepts of bash scripting
so far I've studied: 
1. How to make variables and assign them
2. How to make arguments
3. If-else statement in bash scripting
4. How to read the user input
Im currently using VIM Editor

CODE1 - 
Create and open newscript.sh file in vim editor: 
vim newscript.sh

!#/bin/bash

echo " making variable 1"
var_one=text.txt

echo "now using if-else statement to list some files in the directory and if there is no directory, we will make one"
if [ -d "directoryy" ]
           then var_two=$(ls directoryy)
else
           mkdir directoryy
echo "The directory has been made, if you have to list the files in it use $var_two"
echo " Testing if the $var_one is working "
fi

CODE2 ( to read the user input) - 
!#/bin/bash 
echo "Reading the user input"
read -p " Enter the password " $user_pwd
echo " Thanks for entering your password, Your password is: $user_pwd"

How to use arguments
- You can use arguments with the '$num' 
like in this CODE1 - the first variable that is - var_one=text.txt, 
Instead of text, we can assign it to $1, that is var_one=$1
Results -> at the time of executing the script in the terminal - write = bash filename.sh (argument_text) 
you can assign whatever value to variabe one if you use the aargument.
